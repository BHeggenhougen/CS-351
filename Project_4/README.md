# CUDA Version
Parellelizes the function. The kernel uses a 1-D grid configuration.

# Question 1
Q. Are the results what you expected? Speculate as to why it looks like CUDA isnâ€™t a great solution for this problem.
A. The results are relatively close to what I expected. Using a CUDA kernel has a lot of overhead and unless a great amount of work is done to compensate for that overhead, just using the CPU with generally be faster. Since CUDA was slower in this situation, it means that the work done was probably not enough to justify the overhead required by CUDA. Also, there is not very much parellelization needed by iota, so the advantages of CUDA are not very useful for this problem.
